# Seascape Autonomy Site 

## About

This is Seacape Autonomy's static website based on the [Agency Bootstrap theme](https://startbootstrap.com/themes/agency/), converted to a gem-based Jekyll theme with GitHub Pages support.

The Jekyll structure of this theme includes:

- `_portfolio` files - what generate the portfolio grid. YAML front matter handles all the details
- the `page` layout allows custom pages, as seen in the legal and 404 pages
- `sitetext.yml` enables complete customization of all site text
- `navigation.yml` enables fully customizable navigation
- `style.yml` enables fully customizable colors, background images, and other style-related things
