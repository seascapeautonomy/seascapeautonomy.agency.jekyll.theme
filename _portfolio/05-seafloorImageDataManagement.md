SQUIDLE+ is a software platform for the management, discovery and annotation of marine imagery. It includes map-based exploration interfaces, advanced annotation workflows, summary reporting tools and analytics through a user-friendly frontend and a comprehensive backend. Sharing, collaboration and release of datasets are managed through user groups with granular permissions, and annotations can be acquired from human users and/or automated Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. SQUIDLE+ expedites data delivery and eliminates the need to transfer, copy and/or reprocess data for import. It provides a centralised repository for annotations while maintaining links to the originating imagery hosted on various pre-existing cloud repositories. The platform offers different annotation modes (whole-frame, points, polygons) and is media-type agnostic (images, videos, large-scale mosaics). Integrated QA/QC tools enable cross-validation between human annotators and between humans and machine learning algorithms.
