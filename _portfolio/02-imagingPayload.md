We have develop a compact underwater stereo imaging system designed for capturing precise, three-dimensional images of underwater environments. It consists of a pair of synchronized cameras behind glass domes that allow detailed 3D scene images to be collected.

Key Features:
--------
- Stereo Camera Pair: Two high-resolution, low-light cameras capture synchronized images, allowing for 3D reconstruction of seafloor structures, marine habitats, or underwater assets.
- Waterproof Housing: Pressure-resistant, corrosion-proof housing ensures reliable operation at various depths, rated for 300+ meters (deeper depths available for customised designs).
- Integrated Lighting: LED or laser-based illumination enhances image quality in low-light conditions, reducing shadows and backscatter.
- Compact & Low-Power Design: Small, lightweight construction allows easy integration with AUVs, ROVs, or diver-operated systems.
- Onboard Processing & Data Storage: Real-time image processing and efficient data storage enable quick analysis and post-mission review.

Applications:
------
- Seafloor Mapping & Habitat Monitoring: 3D reconstruction of coral reefs, benthic ecosystems, and underwater structures.
- Asset Inspection: Detailed imaging of pipelines, cables, and submerged infrastructure.
- Archaeology & Search Operations: Precise documentation of underwater wrecks and artifacts.
