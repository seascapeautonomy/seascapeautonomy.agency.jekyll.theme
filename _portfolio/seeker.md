The Seeker AUV is a two-person portable, modular, hover capable and highly manoeuvrable AUV developed at the Australian Centre for Robotics.  Designed for capturing low altitude, high-resolution, geo-referenced seafloor imagery over complex underwater terrain, it can also be readily reconfigured for novel optical, acoustic and water column sensing missions. It is designed to be highly manoeuvrable with the ability to hold position, dive vertically and move in constrained spaces around man-made structures, behind the breaking waves of a beach or over rough reef environments whilst staying close to the seafloor.  Other key design features include an open software and hardware architecture allowing for the integration of additional payloads without significant cost in materials or development effort. The nose and forward regions provide space for additional sensors, including optical or hyperspectral cameras, SONAR systems or water column sensors. The vehicle frame can also be easily extended to allow for additional payload space or battery capacity, further increasing endurance.
