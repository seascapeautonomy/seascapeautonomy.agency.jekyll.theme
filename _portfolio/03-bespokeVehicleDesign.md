The Seeker AUV's open software and hardware architecture allow for the integration of additional payloads without significant cost in materials or development effort. The nose and forward regions provide space for additional sensors, including optical or hyperspectral cameras, SONAR systems or water column sensors. The vehicle frame can also be easily extended to allow for additional payload space or battery capacity, further increasing endurance.
